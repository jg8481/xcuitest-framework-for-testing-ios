# xcuitest-framework-for-testing-ios
An example of how you could potentially implement Page Objects when testing iOS apps using XCTest / XCUITest in Swift

The project was written using Swift v4 and XCode 9.2

Simply open up the 'TestApp' project and build.
Then navigate to the 'BasicTests.swift' file to see an example test that implements the framework.

I have also added a little helper method to check when an element is in the 'selected' state.
